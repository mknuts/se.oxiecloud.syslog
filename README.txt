Syslog made simple

Just one single flowcard that can send syslog messages to a syslog server of your choice.

After app installation, go to app settings and enter the ip, port and ptotocol of your syslog server.
"Message" is the only mandatory parameter, all the others have defaults making it possible to add logging to your flows with a minimal effort.
